# Learn CPP Introductory Course

The following course will be a simple introductory course to C++ and to programming in strictly-typed / compiled languages as well as just languages in general. To truly understand C++ and *any* language you have to know a bit about what makes a programming language and the ways that your code interacts with the computer. 

I propose the following course skeleton / syllabus:

## Syllabus

1. Introductory to Binary Encoding and Computer Memory
   * Hello World in C++ and quick history of C/C++
2. Types in C++ and Making Variables
3. Control Flow: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`
   * Will also touch on `std::cin` and `std::cout` 
4. Functions:
   * Call stack
   * Passing variables
   * Recursion
5. Pointers
   * Back to functions: side effects
6. Stack Memory vs. Heap Memory
7. Arrays
8. Standard Template Library (STL)

Up until 7 this is almost exactly how a C course would look, since we have not touched on anything which makes C++ different from C. So we can stop here and you're familiar in C++ but it's best to know a little more. So part two of the course could very much look like

9. Structs in C and Classes in C++
10. Intro to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
11. Simple Data Structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
12. Trees and Recursive Data Structures
   * C-like implementation vs. C++-like implementation
13.
