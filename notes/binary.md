# Data Types and Intro to Computer Storage

Disclaimer: As this is a course on C++ we will discuss how data types are stored in C/C++, and on Mac or Unix-like (Linux) operating systems. Most will be the same on Windows but I don't know or like anything about Windows so I can't say. 

## Binary Representation of Integers

Definition: "Integer" is a whole number, so -2,-1,0,1,2,3,... are integers while 0.5, 1/3, and pi are not.

Everyone tells you computers deal in ones and zeroes, namely "binary" which means "base 2," but exactly how does different data get turned into sequences of 1s and 0s?

We start with the encoding of integers greater than or equal to 0, then generalize to all integers.

### Base ten and decimal systems

You already know this, but as a refresher, any numeric "decimal" system has a base and a digit
